            <p>When cells divide uncontrollably it is called cancer. Cancer can come in two forms of tumors, benign and malignant. Benign tumors are lumps of cancerous cells that have not spread to other organs and they stay stuck to each other. Malignant cancer however has spread to other organs and organ systems making it much worse than benign. Benign cancer is often just removed through surgery as it is just a large tumor but malignant has to use radiation to kill off all the cancerous cells.</p>

            <p>The current beliefs on why people age are simple. People don't age or grow because their cell grow or get bigger, they age because their cells are dividing and creating new cells that add to the makeup of their body. Therefore people who are taller have their cells divide faster than people who are shorter.</p>

            <p>Daughter cells are similar to parent cells in many different ways. Some of those ways are the same DNA, they both go back through the cell cycle, and they both become parents cells again. After a cell undergoes cell division the daughter cell will have the same DNA as the parent cell because of the S phase in Interphase. Have they split the Daughter and Parent cell will go back through the cell cycle and start in Interphase then go through mitosis and cytokinesis again.After that second set of the cell cycle the daughter cell will become a parent cell and have a daughter cell of its own while the old parent cell is still the parent cell and still dividing.</p>

            <p>In the human body there are many places where the cell cycle is at work and one of them is your hair cells. These cells go through cell division rapidly and that is how your hair grows so quick. However if you get cancer and have to use Chemotherapy it targets any cell that divides rapidly such as the cancer cells in your body and your hair and some parts of your liver. This is used on many breast cancer patients and that is why many of them start to lose their hair. </p>
